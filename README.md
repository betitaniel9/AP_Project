The Attendance Checker is a Python-based application designed to help professors easily track and manage student attendance. The system is built with efficiency and user-friendliness in mind, allowing professors to access student attendance data quickly and manage attendance records without hassle. With a clean, intuitive interface, this application makes the process of tracking attendance more organized, allowing professors to stay on top of student participation.

In addition to managing attendance, the application also includes a Random Student Selector feature, which randomly picks a student from the list. This feature is especially useful in classrooms where professors wish to select students to answer questions or engage in discussions, mimicking a common practice seen in academic settings like the system used by Sir Melvin. This adds an element of interactivity and fairness to class discussions.

Features
1. View Attendance
Professors can easily view attendance records for students based on their name. The application retrieves data from a centralized database and displays it in an organized format, making it simple for professors to monitor student attendance for each class session. The data includes key information like the student’s name, the date of the class, their attendance status (Present/Absent), and other relevant details such as the student’s block and professor’s name.

2. Manage Attendance
The system provides the ability to manage attendance records effectively. Professors can update attendance status, add new records, or modify existing data through an intuitive user interface. This functionality enables professors to ensure that the attendance records are always accurate and up-to-date, and it reduces the time spent on administrative tasks. Whether it's marking a student as present, absent, or late, the application simplifies the process.

3. Random Student Selector
The Random Student Selector is an engaging feature that enables professors to randomly pick a student for recitations, class discussions, or answering questions. This feature promotes active participation from students and can help create a more dynamic classroom environment. With the Random Student Selector, professors no longer have to manually select students, ensuring fairness in the process while keeping students on their toes. It’s inspired by the randomization approach used by Sir Melvin for recitation purposes, offering a way to keep class discussions lively and engaging.

4. Database Integration
The application is integrated with a database to store and manage attendance data efficiently. The database stores student names, attendance records, and other necessary information that is retrieved and updated through the application. This ensures that the data is easily accessible and can be updated in real-time without losing any important information.

5. User-Friendly Interface
The Attendance Checker boasts a clean and simple interface designed to enhance the user experience. Professors can quickly navigate through the application to view or update attendance, or use the random student selector with just a few clicks. The user interface is responsive and works seamlessly, whether used on different screen sizes or devices.

6. Professor-Specific Features
The application allows each professor to view attendance records only for their respective classes. The professor’s name is used as a filter to retrieve relevant attendance data. This makes the application highly personalized for each professor, ensuring that they can focus solely on their own students without interference.
